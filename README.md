# bl_library
Functions created while studying for a BS in computer science.
Everything in here is a function I found useful or interesting.
Some functions are older than others.

BL_BSTREE
---------
(old)A generic binary search tree library. Currently the delete function is broken.

BL_COMPARE
----------
(old)Contains functions that compare some basic types. These could be useful as function pointers in other functions like qsort(). Should probably be deleted.

BL_HASH
-------
A generic hash table library. Implements a chained hash table and has many supporting functions.

BL_HEAP
-------
A generic heap and d-ary heap library. Supports min and max heaps. The d-ary heap allows any number of children per node.

BL_PATH
-------
Contains my first attempt at pathfinding. Written with no prior knowledge of pathfinding algorithms.

BL_QUEUE
--------
A generic queue library. Implemented using a doubly linked list.

BL_SLIST
--------
(old)A generic singly linked list library. Has many supporting functions.

BL_SORT
-------
(old/new)Contains many generic sorting functions. Including: Insertion, heap, merge, non-recursive merge, quick, a better quick, and radix. Some functions are newer than others.

BL_STACK
--------
(old)A simple generic stack library. Implemented using a singly linked list.

BL_STRING
---------
(old)Functions that manipulate strings.

BL_Thread
---------
(old)Experiments with PThreads. Made when I was first learning how to program with multiple threads. Includes a multithreaded quicksort.

BL_UTIL
-------
(old/new)Some utility functions. Includes a partition function and a quick select function.
